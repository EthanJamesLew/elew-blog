# Trollfish

Chess engines that can closely mimic human playing style has been popular in the field of computer chess. Instead of superhuman playing ability, the exploration into engines that attempt to exacerbate opponents through the use of nonsensical or sub-optimal moves while still maintaining a favorable game state, informally called trolling, has been largely uncharted. I developed a chess engine called Trollfish, an novel chess engine that deviates from the traditional focus on finding lines with the highest strength. Rather, it prioritizes lengthy and unconventional play, resulting in nonstandard openings, under-promotion of pawns, and seemingly random piece shuffling in endgames. You can play it [here](https://lichess.org/@/Trollfish-Bot).
