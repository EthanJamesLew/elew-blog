abstract: Koopman operator linearization approximates nonlinear systems of
  differential equations with higher-dimensional linear systems. For formal
  verification using reachability analysis, this is an attractive conversion, as
  highly scalable methods exist to compute reachable sets for linear systems.
  However, two main challenges are present with this approach, both of which are
  addressed in this work. First, the approximation must be sufficiently accurate
  for the result to be meaningful, which is controlled by the choice of
  observable functions during Koopman operator linearization. By using random
  Fourier features as observable functions, the process becomes more systematic
  than earlier work, while providing a higher-accuracy approximation. Second,
  although the higher-dimensional system is linear, simple convex initial sets
  in the original space can become complex non-convex initial sets in the linear
  system. We overcome this using a combination of Taylor model arithmetic and
  polynomial zonotope refinement. Compared with prior work, the result is more
  efficient, more systematic and more accurate.
